      Unfortunately, many marriages end in separation or divorce which can be overwhelming 
      not only for the spouses but the entire family as well. 
      The divorce process involves resolving some issues like the division of property, 
      spousal maintenance (or alimony), and child custody and support. 
      If you are considering a divorce, 
      it is essential that you know your rights to protect your interests, 
      your children’s well being, as well as your assets and finances. 
      High-asset divorces are among the most complex and potentially contentious.
      At Bouvier Law LLP, we have the experience and sophistication to handle matrimonial
      and family law matters for professionals, including athletes, doctors, attorneys,
      and high-profile executives.
