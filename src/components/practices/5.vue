      Our family and matrimonial law attorneys know that life circumstances
      change and we routinely pursue modification proceedings in the courts. 
      In order to modify a divorce judgment, 
      there must be proof that there has been a material and substantial 
      change in circumstances that affects child custody and support or
      spousal maintenance (alimony). Circumstances that can be the basis for a modification include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Relocation involving minor children</li>
      <li>Change in employment status</li>
      <li>Increase or decrease in income</li>
      <li>Unforeseen expenses</li>
      <li>Legal Separation</li>
      <li>Issues concerning visitation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Although our matrimonial attorneys are experienced 
      litigators and comfortable handling a case within the confines 
      of a courtroom, we are committed to resolving cases as 
      amicably and expeditiously as possible.
