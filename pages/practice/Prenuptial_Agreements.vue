      Prenuptial agreements, commonly known as “prenups,” 
      are legal documents that outline how engaged couples will divide their assets if they divorce. 
      And, in recent years, more people have been requesting them, 
      according to a survey of matrimonial lawyers. Our firm offers services concerning the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prenuptial Agreements</li>
      <li>Pre-marriage asset consultation</li>
      <li>Property valuation</li>
      <li>Postnuptial Agreements (made after you are married)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A pre-marital (or pre-nuptial) agreement is entered into before the marriage and specifies each future spouses property 
      ownership and the property rights of each party if they decide to divorce. 
      The benefits of a prenuptial agreement include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides financial clarity</li>
      <li>Reduces conflicts in a divorce</li>
      <li>Avoids division of property by the court</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Well designed premarital and postnuptial agreements will also clarify the management of joint bank accounts,
      household bills, and credit card payments, 
      determine the amount of income that will be set aside for savings, 
      and also specify how disputes will be resolved. 
      In order for the agreement to be approved by the Court, 
      it must be fair, and both parties must enter into it free of coercion.
