        Defense Against Orders of Protection and False accusations of domestic violence
      </strong
    ></p>

    <p>
      If you are involved in an acrimonious divorce, child custody battle, 
      or even a bitter breakup with a jealous and spiteful partner, 
      then he or she may accuse you of domestic violence to “get even.” 
      The mere accusation can stigmatize you because the police are duty-bound to arrest you and the charge is a highly inflammatory one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not only does an allegation of domestic violence threaten you with jail time and a criminal record, 
      but you will also be forced to stay away from your home once an Order of Protection is issued, 
      leaving behind your children. If you are convicted,
      then other collateral consequences include loss of professional licenses and certifications. 
      This makes a domestic violence charge especially devastating for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Educators such as teachers and university professors</li>
      <li>Attorneys</li>
      <li>Doctors and nurses</li>
      <li>Police officers</li>
      <li>Members of the military</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For all of these reasons, if you have been accused of domestic violence, 
      then you need to hire an experienced criminal defense attorney to fight for your rights and your freedom aggressively. 
      They will present your side of the alleged events and uphold your rights in court so 
      that you benefit from the highest degree of legal support possible. 
      A domestic violence charge can destroy a person’s personal and professional life, 
      but the right attorneys will put their extensive training and experience to work for you.
