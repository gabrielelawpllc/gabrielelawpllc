    <p>
      When you decide to get married, 
      it’s a big step and an even bigger commitment. 
      You agree to be taking on care and responsibility for a spouse, 
      and even children. 
      Being fully aware of the laws with regard to marriage is a 
      responsible way to be prepared to avoid any problems down the road.
      Prenuptial agreements, commonly known as “prenups,”
      are legal documents that outline how engaged couples will divide 
      their assets if they divorce. 
      And, in recent years, more people have been requesting them, 
      according to a survey of matrimonial lawyers.

    </ul>

    <p>
      A pre-marital (or pre-nuptial) agreement is entered into 
      before the marriage and specifies each future spouses property 
      ownership and the property rights of each party if they decide to divorce. 
      The benefits of a prenuptial agreement include:
    </p>


    <ul>
      <li>Provides financial clarity</li>
      <li>Reduces conflicts in a divorce</li>
      <li>Avoids division of property by the court</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A well designed premarital agreement will also 
      clarify the management of joint bank accounts, 
      household bills, and credit card payments, 
      determine the amount of income that will be set aside for savings, 
      and also specify how disputes will be resolved. 
      In order for the agreement to be approved by the Court, 
      it must be fair, and both parties must enter into it free of coercion.
